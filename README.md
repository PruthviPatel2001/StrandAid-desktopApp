# Strandaid Survelliance Support Application

This project holds the code for the full stack application that is one of the deliverable products.

The Disaster Rescue Teams can supervise the entire surveillance operation while being a safer distance away from the disaster struck areas This is a full stack application that has the capability to work on any platform including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, or from the web browser of the user. We also provide a Cross Platform Mobile Application that support all major operating systems like Android and iOS. This provides extensive flexibility to the users to choose how they want to control the situation.

It has been designed keeping in mind the effort that will need to be put into training the rescue forces and so provides a fast and intuitive UI that can be navigated in mere seconds. The application communicates with the StrandAid backend to retrieve and display information, as well as to carry out various operations such as data storage, retrieval, and user authentication. It has been built using the Electron JS Framework for the Desktop and Web application, and leverages the React Native JavaScript Framework, making it easier for users to cycle through devices.
